This is especially true in the financial industry which is highly regulated.  These groups add another layer of model review before a model can be implemented. For the most part, statistical models are preferred by validation groups due to the commonly used statistical tests that can be employed to justify / reject the model.  For these reasons there may be bias against implementing a Neural Network or Decision Tree / Random Forest Approach.\n",
